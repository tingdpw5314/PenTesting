# Project Title

**Penetration Testing on IoT Devices**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Devices you need and software for installing the portable pentesting device

```
1. Raspberry Pi
2. micro SD card 
3. Usb wifi adapter (support monitor mode)
4. Kali-Linux for Raspberry Pi
5. Basic network security knowledge
```

### Installing

First, install the kali linux on raspberry pi

```
1. Install Etcher, SDCard Formatter, and Kali-linux image for Raspberry in computer/ laptop.
2. Format the microSD card and flash the kali-linux OS image into it with Etcher.
3. Install your microSD in Raspberry Pi and update it.

Note: The kali-linux for Raspberry Pi has time synchronization issues. Please update the date manually by type "date --set=yyyy-mm-dd" and "date --set=hh:mm" in terminal.
```

## Running the tests

Before you run or modify the bash program, **MAKE SURE** you read the program and understand it. This program is only used for the research purpose at The University of Arizona, it is your **OWN RESPONSIBILITY** if you use it for other purpose.


### Check your adapter interface
```
1. Open terminal and type "iwconfig" to get the name of interface.
2. Change the name of adapter in autoatack.sh with new name that shows up in your kali-raspberry device.
```


### Explore the enviroment
```
1. Type "airomon-ng start [interface name]" to turn on monitor mode.
2. Type "airodump-ng [interface name]" to capture the channel, bssid, essid of your routher.
3. Change the parameters CHANNEL, BSSID and ESSID in autoattack.sh with your new info.
4. Type "airodump-ng --bssid [your bssid] --essid [your essid] -c [router channel] [interface name]" to capture all mac addresses of connected clients.
5. Change the clients' name and corresponsind mac addresses in autoattack.sh with new mac addresses.
```
### Deployment and how to run the test

```
1. Type "bash autoattack.sh" to start attacking.

```
